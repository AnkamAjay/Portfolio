            <h2>Design and Analysis of Gravity Dam using STAAD.Pro</h2>
            <img src="Dam.jpeg" alt="Gravity Dam Project Image">
            <p><strong>Software Used:</strong> STAAD.Pro, AutoCAD</p>
            <p><strong>Team Size:</strong> 3</p>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Second Team Lead</p>
            <p>In this project, we designed and analyzed a gravity dam utilizing STAAD.Pro software. We began by gathering essential data, such as water load on the dam and unit weights, as suggested by our team mentor. Based on this data, we determined the overall dimensions of the dam while considering various stability requirements.</p>
            <p>We evaluated whether the dam could withstand uplift pressure, wind pressure, and hydraulic pressure. These assessments were conducted through manual calculations, referencing the textbook <em>Design of Irrigation Structures</em> by Santhosh Kumar Garg.</p>
            <p>After establishing the design, we performed an analysis in STAAD.Pro, addressing any errors identified in the output results. Finally, we presented our findings using AutoCAD images.</p>

            <h2>Estimation Of Low Cost Housing</h2>
            <img src="House.jpeg" alt="Low Cost Housing Project Image">
            <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> MS Office, MS Excel</p>
            <p><strong>Team Size:</strong> 5</p>
            <p>In this project, we aimed to estimate the construction costs for a 2BHK house while maintaining high quality within a low budget, addressing all the client's requirements. Our approach included the following strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fly Ash Utilization:</strong> We replaced traditional cement with fly ash to enhance sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Materials:</strong> We incorporated naturally available materials, such as stones, robo sand, wood, and bamboo, which are low-maintenance and environmentally friendly.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Design:</strong> We designed multifunctional rooms that optimize space usage, allowing for greater efficiency in smaller areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Recycled Materials:</strong> We utilized recycled materials with high scrap value, along with second-hand fixtures, to further reduce costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through these innovative solutions, we aimed to deliver a high-quality, budget-conscious home that meets the needs of the client.</p>
